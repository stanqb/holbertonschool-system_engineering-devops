This diagram shows a scaled up web infrastructure with component separation:
- 2 Load balancers (HAproxy cluster)
- 2 Web servers (dedicated to static content)
- 2 Application servers (dedicated to business logic)
- 3 Database servers (1 Primary + 2 Replicas)

Additional elements and explanations:

1 Additional Server:
- Added dedicated database servers to separate data layer
- Allows independent scaling of database resources
- Improves performance by dedicating servers to specific functions

Load Balancer Cluster:
- 2 HAproxy servers configured in Active-Passive cluster
- Primary handles traffic, backup takes over if primary fails
- Heartbeat connection monitors health between load balancers
- Eliminates single point of failure at load balancer level
- Provides seamless failover and high availability

Component Separation:
- Web Servers: Handle static content, reverse proxy, SSL termination
- Application Servers: Process business logic, dynamic content, API calls
- Database Servers: Dedicated data storage, optimized for I/O operations

Web Server vs Application Server:

Web Server (Nginx):
- Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
- Acts as reverse proxy to application servers
- Handles SSL/TLS termination
- Manages HTTP caching
- Optimized for high-concurrency static content delivery

Application Server:
- Executes business logic and application code
- Processes dynamic requests and API calls
- Manages sessions and user authentication
- Handles database connections and queries
- Optimized for computational processing

Benefits of this architecture:
- Independent scaling: Each tier can be scaled based on specific demands
- Resource optimization: Servers tuned for their specific roles
- Easier maintenance: Updates to one component don't affect others
- Better security: Network segmentation between tiers
- Improved performance: Specialized servers handle their optimal workloads
- Cost efficiency: Right-size servers for specific functions
- Enhanced monitoring: Clearer metrics per component type
