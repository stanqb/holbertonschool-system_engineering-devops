This diagram shows a secured and monitored web infrastructure with:
- 3 firewalls (1 WAF + 2 host-based)
- 1 SSL certificate for HTTPS
- 3 monitoring clients
- 3 servers with complete infrastructure

Additional elements and explanations:

Firewalls:
- Firewall 1 (WAF): Web Application Firewall at network edge
  - Filters malicious web traffic, SQL injection, XSS attacks
  - Protects before traffic reaches servers
- Firewalls 2 & 3: Host-based firewalls on each server
  - Controls traffic to/from individual servers
  - Provides defense in depth

SSL Certificate:
- Enables HTTPS encryption between user and load balancer
- Protects data in transit from interception
- Ensures authentication and integrity
- Using TLS 1.3 for latest security standards

Monitoring:
- 3 monitoring clients (one per server)
- Collects metrics: CPU, memory, disk, network, application performance
- Sends data to centralized monitoring service (Sumologic/DataDog)
- Enables real-time alerting and performance tracking

Data Collection:
- Agents installed on each server collect system and application metrics
- Data sent via secure HTTPS to monitoring service
- Metrics include: response times, error rates, resource utilization

QPS Monitoring:
- Configure monitoring client to parse nginx access logs
- Count requests per second using log analysis tools
- Set up alerts for abnormal QPS thresholds
- Use tools like GoAccess or custom scripts for real-time QPS tracking

Issues with this infrastructure:
- SSL termination at load balancer: Internal traffic unencrypted
  - Solution: End-to-end encryption or internal SSL certificates
- Single MySQL write server: Bottleneck and single point of failure
  - Solution: Multi-master setup or database clustering
- Identical server components: Resource waste and inefficiency
  - Solution: Separate database servers, use dedicated app servers
  - Results in better resource allocation and easier scaling
