This diagram shows a simple web infrastructure with:
- One server (IP: 8.8.8.8) containing:
  - Nginx web server
  - Application server
  - Application files
  - MySQL database
- Domain name: foobar.com with www record pointing to 8.8.8.8
- User accessing www.foobar.com

Explanations:
1. Server: A physical or virtual machine that hosts and serves the website
2. Domain name: Human-readable address (foobar.com) that maps to server IP
3. DNS record: www is a CNAME record pointing to the main domain
4. Web server (Nginx): Handles HTTP requests and serves static content
5. Application server: Processes dynamic content and business logic
6. Database (MySQL): Stores and manages application data
7. Communication: HTTP/HTTPS protocol over TCP/IP

Issues with this infrastructure:
- SPOF: Single server failure brings down entire website
- Downtime: Maintenance requires server restart, causing unavailability
- Scalability: Cannot handle high traffic loads efficiently
